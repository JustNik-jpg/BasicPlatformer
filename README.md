# BasicPlatformer
Just a basic platformer to test my skills.   
Not much to see?

### Dependencies
In order to build this project you need SDL2 and SDL Image libraries,   
you can put them in respective folders in /include directory    
used versions are SDL2 - 2.0.22, SDL Image - 2.6.1, 
but newer must work just fine.

### Controls
A, D - move right, left  
Space - jump    
LMB, RMB - attack left, right   
R - restart(if died, or just want to start anew)

### Gameplay
Kill all enemies to open the door to the next room (only 2 different rooms for now?)
